/*
 * Calculates the value difference metric (VDM), as described by Stanfill and Walz in "Toward Memory
 * Based Reasoning" (1986). VDM was designed as a distance function specifically for nominal attributes, 
 * and the advantage of VDM is that it was developed to measure the difference between predictive features 
 * by taking the similarity (or dissimilarity) of values into account. 
 * 
 * Using VDM, two values are "closer" if they have more similar classifications. Note: this does not depend
 * on order in which values were given.
